We welcome contributions to this project.

## Contribute as a developer

[Installation instructions](http://regis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for the developer version.



We use the same [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TNOCS/csWeb/) as TNO for the CommonSense framework. Moreover, we follow good coding practices, e.g., laid out by  [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).
You use our .editorconfig to adhere to the basic code style rules of NLeSC.
Coherent style and good coding practices help keeping the code simple, well-documented and, thus, easy to maintain and debug when needed. Sustainability is one of our main goals.
If you would like to contribute to the codebase, fixing issues, or adding a demo, please contact the project developer.


## Contribute as a user

We use the "Issues" in GitHub to keep track of bugs, enhancements, or feature requests. You are welcome to comment on issues or to contribute finding solution/workaround for some problem. You can create new issues for bugs and enhancements that were not reported yet (requires a GitHub account). When submitting an issue, keep in mind these simple guidelines for submitting issues:

 * Try to use meaningful and concise titles.
 * Describe the problem as concise as possible. You can add the traceback, a snippet, or an error message. It would be very helpful if you can describe the steps to reproduce the bugs. In the comments, you can also suggest a solution.
 * For enhancements, we would like to have more information on what you are trying to do. This will helps us in case the feature already exists and is not well-documented.
